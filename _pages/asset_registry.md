Asset registry (`asset-registry`) project is being developed for users to register and query their assets. Some assets might include, physical land, argicultural machinery, water management systems, tractors, etc. Each asset is considered to be a polygon. 

## Prerequisites


<!--are these prerequisite accurate or will this library already be within the stack? If the library is a part of AgStack, how does the user access the library?
* You must have a user account for AgStack.

<!--If this prereq is required, what command should the user run to verify the installation?-->
* Verify that the S2 Geometry library is installed on your local environment. See [S2 Geometry Quick Start](https://s2geometry.io/devguide/cpp/quickstart).

<!--Should the user have python installed to use AgStack? Will Python already be within the stack? -->


## Search for an exisiting asset

You can search for specific assets by entering the geospatial information for your polygon. After you query your polygon, you receive a 256-byte/16-Char alphanumeric unique ID. You can view only the assets that are available from your user account.
  
<!--Enter the following query to search for multiple assets-->

<!--Enter the following query to search for assets with holes-->


<!--## Adding a new asset-->

## Asset registry API

You can enter values to test the Asset registry API. From the AgStack website, click the **_APIs_** drop-down menu. Select _Asset registry_ to view the documentation. 

**Note:** Be sure to open the API in a new tab.

To test the API, click the drop-down arrow for the function that you want to test. Click the **Try it out** button to enter queries.
