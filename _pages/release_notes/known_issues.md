## Documentation known issues

### API real URLs inaccurate 

When you select **Asset registry** from the _APIs_ drop-down tab, the User registry API is displayed while the URL shows, `asset_registry_api`. Similarly, when you select **User registry** from the _Select a definition_ drop-down menu, the URL is not updated accurately.

This is due to the Swagger configuration for selecting definitions. To view the API that you want from the Swagger user interface, you must select the API from the _Select a definition_ drop-down menu.
